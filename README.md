# Purpose

Alternative Technology Considerations: For the backend framework, ExpressJS was evaluated. ExpressJS is well-established and offers more flexibility and large package access suitable for medium to larger applications. We choose NodeJS if it works, if not we will move to PHP which is also a more lenient and easy to use technology which will speed up our development process while providing similar capabilities.

# Challenge Statement

<b>Problem:</b>
Kids lack an engaging online space specifically designed for their unique needs of learning, leaving parents struggling to find age-appropriate events and book resources. We need to create a safe, interactive website, "Kiddies Adventure Zone," that sparks kids' imagination, fosters a love for reading, and connects them to a community of young learners.

<b>Limitation:</b>
Capturing the diverse needs and interests of all children within a single online platform, ensuring content and engagement remains equally appealing across different age groups and learning styles.

<b>Target Audience:</b>
The project is relevant to anyone interested in reading however the main focus is on parents and children under 18years.
Locale: The project's relevance is not tied to a specific location.
